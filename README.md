A bot programmed in python, designed as a stand alone project to shorten and make more comfortable a variety of tasks.
The bot is still under its very initial phase of development and currently only works on Windows. Be aware that this is not a build and so to run this code a python interpreter will be needed, as well as all the modules used.
